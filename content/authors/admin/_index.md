Hi! I'm Gunnika, an undergraduate researcher who is steadily but constantly expanding her skill set in Artificial Intelligence. I'm an ardent believer of the learn-and-implement loop.

At present, I'm interning at the Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences (INMAS), DRDO under Dr. Sushil Chandra, where my work involves dynamically allocating the aircraft control by detecting the level of pilot's cognitive workload. I am also a founding team member at DPhi, a thoughtful initiative to build data culture and democratize Data Science learning.

You will also find me taking sessions, leading communities, writing blogs and participating in hackathons.
