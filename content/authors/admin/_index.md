Hi! 

I'm Gunnika, a CS grad at UC San Diego, who is steadily but consistently expanding her skill set in Artificial Intelligence. I'm an ardent believer of the *learn-and-implement loop*.

I previously worked as a Senior Analyst at Ernst & Young.

I'm a former research intern at the INMAS lab of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) under Dr. Sushil Chandra, where my work involved dynamically allocating the aircraft control by detecting the level of pilot's cognitive workload. Physiological sensors like electroencephalogram (EEG) are employed for this purpose.

I am also a Founding Team Member at DPhi, a thoughtful initiative to build data culture and democratize Data Science learning. We regularly conducted bootcamps, datathons and released intuitive courses in this endeavor. I personally formulated 12 courses and piloted 4 AI bootcamps. We also empowered Software Development firms with Assessment PaaS & facilitated AI hiring by open-innovation challenges.

Apart from this, you will find me taking sessions, leading communities, writing blogs and participating in hackathons.
